Before learning Finnish
-----------------------

Before starting to learn Finnish, I recommend these two steps:

* Learn a bit of grammar.  This site does not really do that, since
  this is just a basic introduction to make you interested.  If you
  have enough time, I recommend the book *Finnish: an essential
  grammar* as a reference.  It is not short, but the beginning is easy
  to read.  I recommend you start reading it until you get bored, and
  resume when you have time.

* Learn some vocabulary.  Starting a Finnish course is much easier if
  you already know basic vocabulary.  I recommend you get some app
  that teaches vocabulary and use it in downtime.  A lot of people use
  the app *Memrise*, and there are lots of lists of Finnish words on
  there.  You can start with the most popular lists there, but beware:
  as you have learned on this site, there are many different forms to
  Finnish words, and the app doesn't capture all of the different
  subtleties of them.
