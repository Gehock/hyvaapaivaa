Before learning Finnish
-----------------------

Before starting to learn Finnish, I recommend these two steps:

* Learn a bit of grammar.  This site is designed to do that, but it
  does not take a very rigorous approach and is mainly to get you
  interested and to know what to look for.  If you have enough time
  and like a highly logical way of learning, I recommend the book
  *Finnish: an essential grammar*.  It is not short, but the beginning
  is easy to read.  I recommend you start reading it until you get
  bored, and resume when you have time or need more details once you
  are in the course.

* Learn some vocabulary.  Starting a Finnish course is much easier if
  you already know basic vocabulary.  I recommend you get some app
  that teaches vocabulary and use it in downtime.  A lot of people use
  the app *Memrise*, and there are lots of lists of Finnish words on
  there.  You can start with the most popular lists there, but beware:
  as you have learned on this site, there are many different forms to
  Finnish words, and the app doesn't capture all of the different
  subtleties of them.  Still, it is an essential tool.

If you can do the two things above, your first Finnish course will be
much more enjoyable.

For reference
-------------

* *Finnish: An Essential Grammar*, by Fred Karlsson.  This is a
  reference book, not a text book, but has very good explanations for
  self-study.  The first chapters are easy to read with no prior
  knowledge, and lay the same groundwork as in this site (though more
  formally).
