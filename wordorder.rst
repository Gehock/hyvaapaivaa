Word order and basic noun cases
===============================

   Much to learn you still have.

   \- *Yoda*

Yoda can speak his sentences in any order.  The same is true for
Finnish.  Along with flexible word order comes some noun cases
(endings/conjugations) which help mark the part of speech of words:
the nominative, genitive(accusative), and partitive.  Word order and
basic noun cases are the subject of this chapter.

You aren't yet ready to learn how to apply the noun cases to different
words, so in this chapter we will just discuss how word order relates
to these cases, and the basic structure of Finnish sentences.  We are
doing this now because it is easy and fun, and helps to set the stage
for what comes next.  In future chapters, you will learn how to
actually apply the genitive and partitive to different words.

Word order
----------

Yoda can change word order and we still understand it.  "The pen is on
the table" is correct, but "on the table is the pen" sounds wrong, but
we can still understand it.  "The cat ate the apple" is correct, but
"the apple ate the cat" means something else.

These word order matters in the second, since "the cat" and "the
apple" are identical parts of speech: the order matters for these.
However, "the pen" is a different form from "on the table".  Because
they are marked differently, the order can be changed.

Since Finnish has flexible word order, there must be something to
keep people from getting confused.  This is the nominative and
genitive(accusative).


Parts of speech
---------------

First, a diversion to grammar of English.  Hopefully you remember at
least the idea of "subject - verb - object".

* In the sentence "I ate the apple", "I" is the *subject* - the thing
  that performs an action.  "ate" is the *verb* - the action.  "the
  apple" is the *direct object*: it has an action done to it.

* In the sentence "I ate in the kitchen", "I" is the *subject*, "ate"
  is the *verb*, and "in the kitchen" is an *indirect object*.  You
  are not acting on the kitchen, it is just some sort of modifier
  which describes how the object happens.

In the first of these, the verb "to eat" is used as a transitive
verb and in the second, it is used intransitively.  *Transitive* means
the verb takes direct object.  *Intransitive* means that the verb does
not take a direct object.  This distinction, and the difference
between subject and object, end up being critical to understand the
Finnish *nominative* and *genitive*.

The Finnish cases: Nominative, genitive, and partitive
------------------------------------------------------

The *nominative* is the basic form of words in Finnish, what you will
be able to look up in a dictionary, and you use when discussing
words.  **Nominative = subject of the sentence**

The *genitive* is formed by adding ``-n`` to the end of the words.  (Not
directly - there are various rules to adding ``-n``, which you will
learn about in the next chapter.  This is my no means the only story,
and a word can have a ``-n`` without being in genitive, too).
**Genitive = direct object of the sentence**.

The *partitive* is formed by adding ``-a`` or ``-ta`` (usually) to the
end of the word (again, with various rules you will learn later).
**The partitive can be used for either the subject or direct object**,
but you can still understand the meaning.

There are a lot of other noun cases, ``-sta``, ``-lle``, etc.  These
are all used for **indirect objects**.

So, there it is.  This is the basics of how Finnish has a flexible
word order, and the nominative and genitive are directly allow that.

Sentence structure
------------------

Finnish has flexible word order, but that doesn't mean it doesn't
matter.  Instead, the word order can imply something as to emphasis or
meaning.

In the simple case, the word order can imply an emphasis:

* TODO: S - V - DO
* TODO: DO - S - V

It can also have a more direct meaning.  For example, in *Suomen
Mestari 1*, you get an example like this:

* ``Kynä on pyödällä`` (The pen is on the table).  This implies that
  a pen (which is already known), and it is on the table.
* ``Pyödällä on kynä`` (On table is pen.  This is called an "existential
  clause", which means that you are introducing a previously unknown
  pen.

(Note that these are sentences have a subject and indirect object, not
subject and direct object - but the point still holds.)

In the *Suomen mestari* series of books, you frequently see lessons
which introduce a certain type of sentence.  This is some combination
of word order and noun cases.  These are more profound than they first
appear: it's not just joining some words you know into a sentence, but
trying to teach you that a certain combination of word order and noun
cases conveys a specific meaning.  Unfortunately, they don't have any
way to tell you all of these things, so you just have to figure it
out, consult a grammar book, or ask your teacher and hope you can
understand the answer.


More rules
----------

If a verb is *transitive*, then the verb *may* have a direct object
always.  If a verb is *intransitive*, the verb can't have a direct
object, so can't be used with the genitive.

* Transitive verbs: ``syödö`` (to eat: you eat something)
* Intransitive verbs: TODO.
* Both: eat(``syödä``)

The other noun cases ("locative cases", ``-Vn``, ``-ss``, ``-sta``,
``-lle``, ``-lla``, ``-lta``) are always *indirect objects* only,
*never* a direct object.

Furthermore, the different noun cases are important.  Some verbs are
*always* used with a particular noun case.  Perhaps more precisely:
some verbs have a meaning which *only* come with a certain noun case
(e.g. ``-sta``).  Some verbs have different meanings depending on what
noun cases are used.  For example, in English, "I reached the house"
means a different thing from TODO".

Complexities
------------

But this isn't the whole story: actually, the case for direct objects
is called the *accusative*, but it is identical to the genitive for
the most part - except for the personal pronouns I=\ `minä`, etc.  But
for simplicity, most places just call it the `-genitive` and then have
an exception for the personal pronouns.  (There is an analogy in
English: the personal pronouns "I", "he", "she", "we", ... have a
different form in a direct object: "me", "him", "her", "us").  In
fact, this is quite direct analogy for this use of a direct object
marker in English.

In the next chapter, you will learn how to actually make these noun
cases for real words.
